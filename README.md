Artemis Financial Secure Software Project
This repository contains artifacts from the Artemis Financial project, which focused on improving the security of their web application. The project involved conducting a vulnerability assessment and refactoring code to enhance the security of sensitive financial data.

Project Overview
Client: Artemis Financial, a consulting firm specializing in individualized financial plans including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.

Objective: To address security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's web application and implement secure coding practices to protect client data.

Key Deliverables
Vulnerability Assessment Report: A comprehensive analysis identifying security risks in the application, such as unencrypted communication and third-party dependency vulnerabilities.
Practices for Secure Software Report: A detailed report outlining the refactoring of the application to comply with security testing protocols, including the implementation of SHA-256 for data integrity and SSL/TLS for secure communication.
Key Security Enhancements
Encryption: SSL/TLS was implemented to ensure secure data transmission.
Data Integrity: SHA-256 hashing was used to verify the integrity of transmitted data.
Dependency Management: The OWASP Dependency-Check tool was utilized to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
Reflection
This project demonstrated the importance of secure coding practices and proactive vulnerability management. By enhancing encryption, data integrity, and dependency management, we improved the overall security of Artemis Financialâ€™s application and protected sensitive client information
