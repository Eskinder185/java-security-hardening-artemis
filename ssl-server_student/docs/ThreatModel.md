# Threat Model - Artemis Financial Application

## Overview

This document provides a STRIDE-based threat analysis for the Artemis Financial web application. STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) helps identify potential security threats and their mitigations.

## Application Context

**Application Type**: Financial web application with REST API
**Key Components**: 
- User authentication and authorization
- Account management
- Financial transactions
- Data storage and retrieval
- API endpoints for client applications

## STRIDE Threat Analysis

|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | User impersonation via stolen credentials | User authentication | High | Medium | Multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, session management |
| **Spoofing** | API endpoint spoofing | REST API | Medium | Low | TLS certificate validation, API authentication tokens |
| **Spoofing** | Man-in-the-middle attacks | Network communication | High | Medium | TLS 1.2/1.3, certificate pinning, HSTS headers |
| **Tampering** | Data modification in transit | Network communication | High | Medium | TLS encryption, message integrity checks |
| **Tampering** | Database injection attacks | Database layer | High | Medium | Parameterized queries, input validation, ORM protection |
| **Tampering** | Client-side data manipulation | Web application | Medium | High | Server-side validation, CSRF protection, secure headers |
| **Repudiation** | Transaction denial | Financial transactions | High | Low | Comprehensive audit logging, digital signatures, transaction IDs |
| **Repudiation** | User action denial | User actions | Medium | Medium | Session logging, user activity tracking, non-repudiation mechanisms |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive data exposure | Database/API | High | Medium | Encryption at rest, field-level encryption, access controls |
| **Information Disclosure** | Error message information leakage | Application errors | Medium | High | Generic error messages, secure error handling |
| **Information Disclosure** | Session hijacking | User sessions | High | Medium | Secure session management, session timeout, secure cookies |
| **Denial of Service** | Application overload | Web server | Medium | High | Rate limiting, resource quotas, DDoS protection |
| **Denial of Service** | Database exhaustion | Database | High | Medium | Query optimization, connection pooling, resource limits |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Unauthorized access escalation | Authorization system | High | Low | Role-based access control, principle of least privilege |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Privilege escalation via vulnerabilities | Application code | High | Low | Regular security updates, vulnerability scanning, code review |
